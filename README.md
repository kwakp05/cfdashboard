# CF Dashboard Overview

Want to know your performance on all your contests?

Want to know how close you were to performing as an Expert?

Want to know the proportion of Candidate Masters that solved problem C?

Want to know how many problems you need to solve to get Grandmaster?

Want to know how fast you need to solve to get Specialist?

[CF Dashboard](https://cf-dashboard-fff53.web.app/) can give you all of this information.

# How it works

CF Dashboard answers two key questions:

* I placed Xth in a contest, what rating title do I deserve?

* I want to get [insert rating title here], what rank should I get?

For example, in round, getting XXXth rank earns you rating YYYY (title). In the same round, to get Grandmaster, you need to solve A - B 

Both of these questions can be answered thanks to the [Open Codeforces Rating System](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20762).

We can calculate your deserved rating for any contest. CF Dashboard obtains contest standings from the [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp) and uses your rank to give you your performance (deserved rating) based on your rank.
